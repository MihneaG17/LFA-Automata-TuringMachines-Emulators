# LFA-Automata-TuringMachines-Emulators
Python Emulators for DFA, NFA, PDA and Turing Machines </br>
This repository includes four Python emulators: one for a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton), one for a NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton), one for a PDA (Pushdown Automaton) and one for a Turing Machine that calculates the sum of two numbers in unary system (represented as 0s). </br>
The .txt, .dfa, .nfa, .pda files contains the corresponding definitions of each automaton, divided into sections that describes the computational models.
As long as the text files are correctly defined, the emulators should perform any operation that can be done by that model. </br>
